# Interactive cancer maps

* Twenty years ago the most common Geographic Information System was the paper map or road atlas
* Now our cell-phones can ask the internet how to get to where we want to go, efficiently
* Understanding how cancer events unfold in different geographic regions is important for public health
	* Are there important environmental hazards at specific locations?
	* Are there clues to genetic origins of particular cancers?
	* Are culturally shared behaviors leading to increased risk?
* Even though we are comfortable with annotated maps, creating and using "cancer maps" to reason about cancer risk requires some training
* In this notebook we will work with some interactive maps on the web, and we will produce some maps using R programming

## Exercises

Use the [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) map tool](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/online-analysis-map?v=2020&mode=population&mode_population=continents&population=900&populations=900&key=asr&sex=0&cancer=39&type=0&statistic=5&prevalence=0&population_group=0&ages_group%5B%5D=0&ages_group%5B%5D=17&nb_items=10&group_cancer=1&include_nmsc=0&include_nmsc_other=0&projection=natural-earth&color_palette=default&map_scale=quantile&map_nb_colors=5&continent=0&show_ranking=0&rotate=%255B10%252C0%255D) to survey mortality from cancer in 2020 for individuals aged 10-24. You should see something like the display below.

![IARC map](IARCoverall.jpg)

- True or False: Age standardized mortality from cancer in 2020 for persons aged 10-24 is greater in Vietnam than in neighboring countries.

Use the IARC map tool to produce a worldwide map of breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79.

- What is the Scandinavian country with largest estimate of age-standardized breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79?
