# Clinical trials for cancer treatments

- Despite massive investments in cancer research and treatment development,
cancer remains a leading cause of death

- We have examined many aspects of cancer's diversity
    - tissue of origin
    - somatic mutations
    - response to treatment

- The main modalities of medical response to cancer are
    - surgery
    - chemotherapy
    - radiation

- Each of these modalities has a collection of subtypes, and they are often used in combination

- How do doctors and patients navigate the available options?
    - Answer: interpret available data as evidence in favor of or against certain options

- The "gold standard" for evidence in medical decisionmaking is the randomized clinical trial (RCT)
