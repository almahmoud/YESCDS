# Preliminaries

In this segment we will review basic definitions underlying
the use of data to understand variation in genetic processes connnected
with initiation and progression of cancer.

## Human genome

The human genome is composed of 22 autosomal chromosome pairs
and 1 pair of sex chromosomes.  Autosomal chromosomes are numbered 1-22;
females have a pair of X chromosomes, and males have a pair labeled X and Y.

## Central dogma

"DNA makes RNA makes protein"

The genetic material from which chromosomes are formed is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

DNA is transcribed to RNA (ribonucleic acid)

RNA is translated to protein.

## Gene counts by chromosome

"Gene" refers to a physical and functional component of the genome that
is inherited between generations.

Gene finding and gene counting are basic tasks of bioinformatic analysis.

The sizes of chromosomes and numbers of genes currently known are depicted here:

# Views of genomic variation in breast cancer

## A [2012 view](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22522925) of the whole genome

In this display, the chromosomes are ordered across the screen, from 1 to 22 followed by X.

Because this display concerns breast cancer in females, no Y chromosome is depicted.

The display is focused on "copy number alterations" (CNAs) in tumors -- where (possibly large)
segments of chromosomal
DNA have been duplicated or deleted in the tumor.  Red spikes denote positions where
duplicating CNAs are associated with expression changes of nearby genes, blue spikes
where a deleting CNA affects expression.

![Genome-wide drivers](shahGenomeWide.jpg)

The figure above is drawn from a paper studying 2000 breast tumors.  A more recent [survey](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.700568/full)
shows that the phenomenon pervades a broad spectrum of cancer types studied in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA).

## TCGA: common mutations; TTN mutation and survival
